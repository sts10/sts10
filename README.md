### Hi there 👋

<!--
**sts10/sts10** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🛠️  I'm currently contributing to [Hush Line](https://hushline.app/), an anonymous tip line.
- 📒 I'm interested in passphrases, technical writing, documentation, security, privacy, user education, and archiving.
- 💪 Some things I'm proud of: [Orchard Street Wordlists](https://github.com/sts10/orchard-street-wordlists) and [Schlinkert pruning](https://sts10.github.io/2022/08/12/efficiently-pruning-until-uniquely-decodable.html)
- 🔍 I'm looking for work!
