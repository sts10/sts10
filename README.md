### Hi there 👋

<!--
**sts10/sts10** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🔭 I'm currently working on [Tidy, my tool for creating word lists](https://github.com/sts10/tidy).
- 📒 I'm interested in passphrases, technical writing, documentation, security, privacy, user education, and archiving.
- Something I'm proud of: [Schlinkert pruning](https://sts10.github.io/2022/08/12/efficiently-pruning-until-uniquely-decodable.html)
- 🔍 I'm looking for work!
- 📫 How to reach me: see [samschlinkert.com](https://www.samschlinkert.com/#contact) or on <a rel="me" href="https://hachyderm.io/@schlink">Mastodon</a>.
